# Quick Check

Run a fast validation of the codebase to ensure everything compiles and tests pass.

## Steps

1. Run `cargo check` to verify compilation
2. Run `cargo test` to execute all tests
3. Report any compilation warnings or test failures
4. If all pass, confirm the codebase is healthy
5. Suggest running `cargo clippy` for additional lints if desired
